    <h1>The Art Of Dungeon Diving</h1>
    <h2>
      This webpage will give you a better understanding of how to complete the
      Destiny2 Dungeon "Ghost Of The Deep".
    </h2>
    <p>
      So you're new to the game and you want ot tackle one of the best parts of
      the grind experience. The most important thing is to have information on
      the boss type and their weakness and strengths. for example in Ghost Of
      The Deep the second encounter is a hive knight those are weak to swords,
      he also has a powerful over shield that needs to be removed quickly. The
      best weapon I have found for this boss is the exotic sword The Lament, it
      quickly removes his barrier and deals a substantial amount of damage to
      hive.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last boss its important to learn the puzzle to get her to damage
      phase it's much more complicated than the previous puzzles. once you
      understand how to get her into that damage phase oyu need to know the best
      way to burn her health down as fast as possible. the Lament is rather
      useless in this engagement so you need to change your strategy completely,
      the key to your success is The Arbalest an exotic linear fusion rifle that
      removes the shield immediately. you will also need a high dps heavy linear
      fusion rifle if you have a team then Whisper Of The Worm is a great heavy
      to carry into this fight. This boss never touches the ground so make sure
      all equipped supers can reach her and all your weapons are mid-long range.
